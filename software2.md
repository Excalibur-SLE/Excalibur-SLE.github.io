## Software workshop "SYCL" 17 February 2021

The Excalibur DDWG for System-Level Engineering will be holding a
second Software Training Workshop on 17 February 2021, hosted by Codeplay
Software Ltd. The session with run from 13:00-16:00.


## HPC Development Using C++ and SYCL

SYCL is a programming model that targets a wide variety of devices
(CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and more) from a single code base. SYCL supports a
single-source style of programming from completely standard C++. With
increasingly heterogeneous processor roadmaps, a platform-independent
model such as SYCL is essential for software developers.

This tutorial follows on from the [previous one](software1.md), where we introduced SYCL.
The tutorial is constructed around hands-on exercises that will help reinforce the
concepts presented during the session.

Please [register for this event](). Registration is limited to 25 participants.
