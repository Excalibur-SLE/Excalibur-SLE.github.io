## Workshop on "Data Assimilation and Uncertainty Quantification" 24-25 September 2020

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) includes the propagation of
uncertainty from inputs to outputs through simulators, as well as
inverse problems resulting from the calibration of models against
observations. One key tool is building emulators (surrogate
statistical models) to replace computationally expensive
simulators. Data assimilation (DA) synergizes computer simulations and
real-world data, e.g. from weather prediction to hazard modelling,
urban analytics and biological science, with observations used to
update simulations in real time. With the interaction between forward
simulations and information-driven methods, techniques for UQ and DA
are specifically challenged by the scale of problems that exascale
computing will enable. Developing efficient UQ and DA algorithms will
also be a major challenge, with close collaborations between RSEs and
researchers necessary.
