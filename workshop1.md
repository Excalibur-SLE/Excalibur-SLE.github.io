## Workshop on "Software Engineering" 14-15 July 2020
### 13:00 BST - 17:00 BST each day

Getting scientific applications ready for exascale is a huge
undertaking. Very few of today’s codes can take full advantage of
current Tier-1 systems, such as the 750,000 core ARCHER-2, let alone
the millions of cores on heterogeneous systems that are anticipated
with exascale. This workshop will explore the challenges facing the
scientific computing community, and cover exascale readiness
techniques such as performance portability, algorithmic fault
tolerance, asynchronous programming, and improving scalability. The
workshop will include contributions from experts from international
exascale initiatives such as ECP in the USA and EuroHPC. It will also
include input from leading vendors such as Cray/HPE, NVIDIA, AMD,
Intel and Codeplay. Key questions will be: (i) how different
simulation tools can be software-engineered for interoperability at
scale; (ii) how future software engineering and new languages
abstractions most effectively support the separation of concerns in
development; and, (iii) how multi-physics simulations can optimally
exploit heterogeneous hardware platforms.
