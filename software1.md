## Software workshop "SYCL" 7-8 January 2021

The Excalibur DDWG for System-Level Engineering will be holding a
Software Training Workshop on 7-8 January 2021, hosted by Codeplay
Software Ltd. Sessions will run for two days, in the afternoons only.


## HPC Development Using C++ and SYCL

SYCL is a programming model that targets a wide variety of devices
(CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and more) from a single code base. SYCL supports a
single-source style of programming from completely standard C++. With
increasingly heterogeneous processor roadmaps, a platform-independent
model such as SYCL is essential for software developers.

In this tutorial, we introduce SYCL and also help developers
understand how to migrate code from CUDA to SYCL. The tutorial is
constructed around hands-on exercises that will help reinforce the
concepts presented during the session.

Please [register for this event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hpc-development-using-c-and-sycl-tickets-133326062843). Registration is limited to 25 participants.
