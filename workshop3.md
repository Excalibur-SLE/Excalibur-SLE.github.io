## Workshop on "Towards Exascale Simulation of integrated engineering systems at extreme scale"

### 21–22 January, 2021

The imminent deployment of exascale computing will usher in a new era
of engineering system prediction, design and optimisation. It would
enable a whole-system approach in a seamless fashion that
significantly cuts the development cycle and cost. Before such a full
potential can be realised, a fundamental rethink is needed about
how we construct physical models and application software codes for
the new computer architectures and software libraries. Sophisticated
engineering systems typically involve multi-physical processes, such
as flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, electromagnetics,
acoustics, and fluid-structure interaction, often in complex
geometries. Spatial scales can span 9-12 orders of magnitude and the
range of temporal scales can be even wider. In most cases, computer
codes have been developed and optimised for specific applications with
a limited range of time and length scales. The corresponding models
and numerical methods pose different challenges on exascale
computers. How to integrate existing methods and/or develop completely
new methods to make full use of exascale computing is a grand
challenge for mathematicians, physicists, computer scientist as well
as engineers. In this workshop, leading experts in the field will
showcase recent efforts in the development of modelling methodologies,
computer algorithms, software interfaces, and software/hardware
co-design in preparation for the arrival of exascale
computing. Cutting-edge simulations of engineering systems at extreme
time and length scales will be demonstrated. Finally, existing gaps
and remaining issues will be identified to stimulate further
discussions and actions in the field.
